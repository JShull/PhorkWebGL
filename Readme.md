## Details

* The ForkLift model and textures were all created by BaTo in Maya and imported to align with a Unity3D controller asset via [WSM Game Studio](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/29374)
* Integration, setup, compilation, and UI work all created by John Shull :smile:
* We anticipated in using the WebXR work done by [Mozilla](https://github.com/MozillaReality/unity-webxr-export), unfortunately this work hasn't really been updated in a while... big shout-out to [De-Panther](https://github.com/De-Panther) as he's created and updated a version of this that has been continuously supported and distributed via OpenUPM. You can find more information about the WebXR packages [here](https://github.com/De-Panther/unity-webxr-export)
